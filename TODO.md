Take the base64 string generated by go and see if the C++ code can decode it into a valid token!

----

Update web app to generate a response with JSON for data, with a base64 encoding of the encrypted connect token,
and then JSON fields for all the other bits of data the client needs to have returned to them.

Now work out how to get the client passing in the parameters of what they want for the match, eg. their clientId
and the protocolId they are looking for.

What to return if no match can be found? JSON with no servers to connect to, failure error code? no connect token?

Seems like I can use docker export to easily keep builder and runner instances separate, eg: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/export/

I could use this export to build a C++ program, test it, and then export the binaries in a tar file, copy that tar file into the runner

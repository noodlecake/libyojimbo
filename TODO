    --------------

    Add large block support:

    1. Extend the system to support large blocks from example source code

    2. Bring across unit tests for large blocks

    --------------

    Idea of block message having a real serialize function (fragment 0), but also a block attached to it is sexy.

    This could be really flexible, for example for a large block you want to send across, but with some free from data you 
    also want to send with it, eg. metadata describing that block.

    The idea also of having different blocks as message types, so you can distinguish different blocks sent is really strong.

    Nice!

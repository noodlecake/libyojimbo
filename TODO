DONE    

TODO

    ------------------

    Should probably take the effort now to integrate proper allocators.

    No point doing all the work for separate allocators and factories when the actual allocators just shim to malloc
    
    This is important too because I think I will want to rework the server to have one allocator per-client (for simplicity),
    and from this allocator create the message factory, pass in as stream allocator, use for packet factory and so on.

    ------------------
    
    First step, build an allocator on top of tcmalloc

    ------------------

    Packet fragmentation and reassembly.

    Definitely needed for large snapshot blocks.

    Default to maximum packet size of 8k, so up to 7 ~1200 MTU packets

    ------------------

    v0.3.0 release (!!!) YEY! :D

    ------------------

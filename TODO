TODO

    Extend soak test to also include sending and receiving blocks.

    Add callbacks from connection -> client/server so I can print out logs when fragments are received.

    Make sure the callbacks are enough to print out progress, for example a connection progress or download bar progress for a very large block.








    --------------

    Idea of block message having a real serialize function (fragment 0), but also a block attached to it is sexy.

    This could be really flexible, for example for a large block you want to send across, but with some free from data you 
    also want to send with it, eg. metadata describing that block.

    The idea also of having different blocks as message types, so you can distinguish different blocks sent is really strong.

    Nice!

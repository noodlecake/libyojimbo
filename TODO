DONE    

TODO

    ------------------

    Should probably take the effort now to integrate proper allocators.

    No point doing all the work for separate allocators and factories when the actual allocators just shim to malloc

    ------------------

    Packet fragmentation and reassembly.

    Definitely needed for large snapshot blocks.

    Default to maximum packet size of 8k, so up to 7 ~1200 MTU packets

    ------------------

    v0.3.0 release (!!!) YEY! :D

    ------------------

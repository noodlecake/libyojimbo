DONE    

TODO    

    Implement a better estimate of the per-message id overhead.

    This estimate must consider the relative serialization of ids in order to be accurate. Do it.

    ------------------

    Implement an unreliable channel.

    Unreliable channels don't support fragmentation and reassembly of large blocks, that has to be done at the MTU level.

    This is for large delta snapshots.

    The same channel could be used for unreliable messages that go at the end of the packet, if there is room, eg. sounds, effects.

    Unreliable messages don't serialize the message id.

    Unreliable messages. You might want to include more than you think will fit in the packet, and include a budget, that way you can fit as many in as possible.

    This is a good way to possibly fill up any gaps left in the packet due to conservative estimates for the other parts of the packet.

    ------------------

    Packet fragmentation and reassembly.

    Definitely needed for large snapshot blocks.

    Default to maximum packet size of 8k, so up to 7 ~1200 MTU packets

    ------------------

    v0.3.0 release (!!!) YEY! :D

    ------------------

    Packet compression

    ------------------

    Large block compression

    ------------------

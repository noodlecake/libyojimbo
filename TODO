DONE    

TODO

    ------------------

    Next, add the packet factory to the context.

    Now when a packet is read in, see if a context exists, and if it does, use the packet factory in the context instead of the global factory on the transport.

    At this point, packets should be getting allocated from the per-client packet factories where appropriate, and the global packet factory for all other packets.

    ------------------

    Packet fragmentation and reassembly.

    Definitely needed for large snapshot blocks.

    Default to maximum packet size of 8k, so up to 7 ~1200 MTU packets

    ------------------

    v0.3.0 release (!!!) YEY! :D

    ------------------

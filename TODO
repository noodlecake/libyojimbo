TODO

    Server needs its own config now. So does the client. Config is required for the # of bytes to create for the allocators.

    ServerConfig, ClientConfig.

    Use the globals for the default values (which are shared between client and server)

    Move as many of these as possible into the config.

    ------------------

    Next step is to specify in the server configuration a per-client amount of memory in bytes, and a global allocator number of bytes.

    Then, setup a function to create an allocator for each client, as well as a global allocator.

    Leave the client and server using default allocator (malloc) by default, except for the global and per-client allocator that use tlsf.

    Now make sure all the packet factory, message factory and stream allocator go through the same allocator: 

    Add an interface something like this:

        GetGlobalAllocator()

        GetClientAllocator( int clientIndex )

    ------------------

    Packet fragmentation and reassembly.

    Definitely needed for large snapshot blocks.

    Default to maximum packet size of 8k, so up to 7 ~1200 MTU packets

    ------------------

    v0.3.0 release (!!!) YEY! :D

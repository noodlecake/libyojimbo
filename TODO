DONE    

TODO

    ------------------

    Next create global and per-client allocators on server, and one allocator on client.

    Make sure these allocators are dynamically created according to config via virtual functions. 

    Add an interface something like this to the server:

        GetGlobalAllocator()

        GetClientAllocator( int clientIndex )

    And for the client, just:

        GetClientAllocator()

    ------------------

    Rework the transport so it can be created optionally without a packet factory.

    Add a SetPacketFactory method

    Create the packet factory for client and server internally via a virtual.

    Make sure it the transport has SetPacketFactory called on it.

    ------------------

    Make sure that all client/serevr test cases in test.cpp and elsewhere remove the packet factory from setup.

    ------------------

    Now make sure all the packet factory, message factory and stream allocator go through the same allocator: 

    ------------------

    Make sure all tests pass with limited memory per-client.

    ------------------

    Packet fragmentation and reassembly.

    Definitely needed for large snapshot blocks.

    Default to maximum packet size of 8k, so up to 7 ~1200 MTU packets

    ------------------

    v0.3.0 release (!!!) YEY! :D

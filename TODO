DONE    

TODO
    
    ------------------

    Now I need to work out how to get a separate packet factory per-client going.

    There needs to be a global packet factory, and a per-client packet factory.

    Packet factory needs to be extended to have a limit on the # of packets to be allocated.

    If too many packets allocated (eg. NULL packet allocation) set an error level and disconnect that client.

    If it's a global packet allocator, ignore, but log it. We're probably getting DDOS'd. Maybe if the global packet allocator is in an error state,
    clear that error state, and then engage a mode where clients get a complicated challenge that takes time to compute, eg. TNL style.

    ------------------

    Consolidate the message factories, server class, client class so they are not duplicated in test.cpp. Use the ones in shared.h

    ------------------

    Packet fragmentation and reassembly.

    Definitely needed for large snapshot blocks.

    Default to maximum packet size of 8k, so up to 7 ~1200 MTU packets

    ------------------

    v0.3.0 release (!!!) YEY! :D

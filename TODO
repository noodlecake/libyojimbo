DONE    

TODO

    ------------------

    Add a limit on the number of messages allocated per-client, and track that in the message factory.

    If too many messages are allocated, return NULL. This should disconnect that particular client.

    Perhaps the message factory should detect NULL message being allocated, and set an error flag that can be checked later -> disconnect.

    ------------------

    Add a limit on the # of bytes allocated in the stream allocator. If a stream allocation fails, it is the responsibility
    of the serialize function to handle this and return false.

    Check the stream allocator per-client each advance time, if it is in an error state, disconnect that client.

    ------------------

    Consolidate the message factories, server class, client class so they are not duplicated in test.cpp. Use the ones in shared.h

    ------------------

    Add a test for client server sending messages with multiple clients.

    This test ensures the context is working correctly, message factories are setup correctly etc.

    Right now there is only a test that sends messages from between client 0 and server. This means I have to run profile.cpp to test that context manager is working correctly.

    ------------------

    Implement test_client_server_stream_allocator.

    Need a packet and/or message type that tests dynamic allocations using the stream allocator for that particular client.

    This is a feature so there needs to be a functional test that check the feature is actually working to find regressions.

    ------------------

    Packet fragmentation and reassembly.

    Definitely needed for large snapshot blocks.

    Default to maximum packet size of 8k, so up to 7 ~1200 MTU packets

    ------------------

    v0.3.0 final release (!!!) YEY! :D

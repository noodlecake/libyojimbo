    Now to get started with https://github.com/vstakhov/libucl

    Write code to can serialize read and write a connect token to JSON such that tokens can easily be created in golang 
    or any other web lang that would implement a REST API for the backend.

    Documentation is here: https://github.com/vstakhov/libucl/blob/master/doc/api.md

    Study the API and see if it's worth using.

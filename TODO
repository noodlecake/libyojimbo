    What to do next?

    Time for some general cleanup while I think over the next steps.

    Add test_queue

    Bring across tests for large blocks

    Add implementation of platform_time for windows.

    ------------------

    Large block of data (eg. snapshot data) -- a large unreliable message at front of packet?

    Set of unreliable messages at the end of the packet (eg. effects and sounds?)

    Concept of channels? Let user specified channel config? Seems like the correct approach.

    Would be a shame to hard-code the packet layout, if it could easily be made flexible.

    For example, unifying everything as "messages" is probably a good concept.

    Sending a message on a particular channel id is a good metaphor, vs. having functions "SendUnreliableMessage", "SendReliableMessage", "SendSnapshot".

    Packet fragmentation and reassembly.

    Packet aggregation.

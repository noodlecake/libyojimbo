    ------------------

    Packet fragmentation and reassembly.

    Definitely needed for large snapshot blocks.

    Default to maximum packet size of 8k, so up to 7 ~1200 MTU packets

    ------------------

    Idea: instead of doing it at the packet level, do fragmentation it at the message fragment level.

    So if a large block is sent, send n connection packets instead of just one, each connection packet would include a fragment of the unreliable block.

    This is probably the easiest way to implement, vs. trying to pull it out and implementing it somehow at the transport layer as a proper, OK end result MTU packets need to be split up and reassembled. Could get messy.

    It would probably involve much less copying as well.

    Think it through. Pros and cons.

    Cons: If the user wants to create a large PACKET they can't... they have to use messages.

    Not too bad of a trade-off I think. Messages are the primary way to get the functionality out of this engine.

    v0.3.0 release (!!!) YEY! :D

--------------

Tightly integrate connection with client/server packets. I don't see any reason why it should be used without the client/server *packet set*.

Otherwise it become so frustrating everytime a new feature is added to client/server protocol. It has to have a strange configuration rules that links it up to client/server...

Similarly, client/server needs to have its own context automatically setup in the packet factory.

Bottom line: I don't want the user to have to do *ANYTHING* to enable client/server usage of messages except pass in a message factory.

--------------

Add large block support:

1. Extend the system to support large blocks

2. Bring across tests for large blocks

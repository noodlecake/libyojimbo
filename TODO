DONE    

TODO

    Next step is to specify in the server configuration a per-client amount of memory in bytes, and a global allocator number of bytes.

    Then, setup a function to create an allocator for each client, as well as a global allocator.

    Leave the client and server using default allocator (malloc) by default, except for the global and per-client allocator that use tlsf.

    Now make sure all the packet factory, message factory and stream allocator go through the same allocator: 

    Add an interface something like this:

        GetGlobalAllocator()

        GetClientAllocator( int clientIndex )

    ------------------

    Packet fragmentation and reassembly.

    Definitely needed for large snapshot blocks.

    Default to maximum packet size of 8k, so up to 7 ~1200 MTU packets

    ------------------

    v0.3.0 release (!!!) YEY! :D

WOULD BE NICE

    ------------------

    AEAD idea. Protocol is currently vulnerable to being spammed invalid connect tokens.

    Of course, an invalid connect token won't decrypt, but a connect token that is an old stale token (reply attack) *will* decrypt.

    So I think the key way to avoid replay attacks being effective, is to store the timestamp in the additional data section of the AEAD of the connect token.

    That way a reused connect token can be discarded quickly, by just checking the timestamp. 

    If the timestamp is modified, then the signature check will quickly reject before the decrypt. 

    This way, attackers cannot force an expensive decrypt connect token without actaully getting a token from the matcher (in the last 30 seconds...)

    ^---- This is important. This should be fixed.

    ------------------

    Seems a bit annoying now having both server config and connection config.

    Probably should move the connection config inside the server and client config.

    Think about it.    

    ------------------

    Default allocator should store block size in 4 bytes preceding the allocated block

    This way the default allocator can report on # of bytes allocated.

    Right now it cannot.

    ------------------
    
    Add a test for a very large message send queue (and large # of messages per-packet) with a tiny message receive queue.
    
    This would make sure we never send messages that the reciever can't buffer. Right now it's possible for all the unit tests 
    to pass, even if the code under stress will send messages that the reciever can't buffer.

    ------------------

    const int MaxEncryptionMappings = 1024;

    This should go away. Dynamically allocate max encryption mappings as a function of max clients in the server when started.

    (This is the reason I was getting silent client connect failures when I tried to increase above 1024 clients...)

    ------------------

    This should go away as well

    const int MaxContextMappings = 1024;

    It doesn't need to be 1024. You only need one context mapping per-connected client.

    Once it's dynamically sized, it can be tighter.

    ------------------

    Would really like a nice way in debug builds to warn the user about stuff, eg. better than an assert, an assert with a message.

    For example, a lot of asserts seem really low level, but they just mean, OK, you added your own packet types, but forgot to override the callback "CreatePacketFactory".

    The last thing I want is a user experiencing a bunch of really obscure low-level asserts when they are just trying to use the library.
    
    ------------------

    Definitely need more usage documentation and samples showing how to do stuff.

    I don't know that it's immediately obvious how to use libyojimbo from the samples. Or, what exactly libyojimbo does or what it's for?

    Also, better documentation could be added explaining what yojimbo is for (dedicated servers), and how its protocol works.

    Perhaps a bunch of posts to gafferongames.com would be a good idea to start?

    ------------------

    Make sure that all code that creates packets is aware that it could get a NULL value returned. 

    All message and packet create should gracefully handle packet create being NULL and set an error condition on the connection, or ignore, whichever is appropriate.

    ------------------

    Add tests to make sure the client can recover and reconnect after one of the error states below. eg. error is properly cleared.

    ------------------

    Add unit tests for all the new client error states:

        CLIENT_STATE_PACKET_FACTORY_ERROR
        CLIENT_STATE_MESSAGE_FACTORY_ERROR
        CLIENT_STATE_STREAM_ALLOCATOR_ERROR

    ------------------

    Add a unit test that actually exercises the stream allocator.

    ------------------

    Add a unit test that intentionally exhausts the stream allocator.

    ------------------

    At some point I'm going to want to clean up some old large binary files in the repository that were accidentally committed
